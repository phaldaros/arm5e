This section explains how to manage the seasonal activities of the troupe through years, including activities spanning multiple seasons.

**Important note**: All the constraints described below can be temporary or permanently ignored by disabling the new setting: *Enforce schedule constraints*

The scheduling of activities can be managed from 3 similar dialogs with different goals, there are all accessible through the astrolab icon: ![](systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/astrolab.png)
## Workflow

The workflow is supposed to go like this:

- The GM is setting the current date in the future when the next game session is supposed to happen, "giving" seasons to the players
- The players can plan and apply their activities up to that date. 

## Constraints

- You can not apply an activity if another prior activity (ie: in the past) is still unapplied.
- It is not possible to apply an activity that ends in the future but it is ok to schedule it and apply when the time has come.
- A per RAW, some types of activity are exclusive and other can coexists. One exception to RAW is adventuring which is often house-ruled as not conflicting

## Character calendar

This dialog is accessible from the Actor.Diary tab, it lists all the planned activities for this actor.

- Each rectangle of the table represent a season, a dotted line indicates it is in the future
- The blue color indicates that some activity is planned for the season
- A red color indicates that a conflict exists between two or more activities (eg: reading 2 books the same season)
- Each icon represents an activity, hovering will display its title, clicking will display its sheet.
- A red aura around an activity indicates that it is not yet applied.

## Activity scheduling

This dialog is accessed from the diary entry sheet

All of the above applies but additionally it allows to move the activity to another season (or seasons).
- To be able to schedule the activity:
	- There must be no conflict
	- A number of seasons based on the duration must be ticked.

## Troupe scheduling

Accessed through the Astrolabium, this dialog allows the GM to have a general view year by year of the activities of each character. It is possible to filter the type of actor displayed
