# General

## I have got this warning when I create a new world: "You don't have a Actor of type 'magicCodex' in your world, some functionality will be disabled/not working, you can import the one in the Magi compendium".

Nothing to worry about, this is normal. You just have to follow instructions and import it from the Magi Compendium or create it from scratch. It will disappear on next reload.

## I cannot edit the characteristic of a character.

It is probable you have an active effect giving a modifier to this characteristic. Workaround: In the "Effects" tab, suspend the effect in question for the time being in order to edit the characteristic.

# Abilities

## What are the fields "Ability key" and "Option" for?

The Ability Key field is used by the system to know which ability it is. That way you can name it as you wish and in the language you prefer. The option field is read-only most of the time, but it is used for generic abilities (eg: Area Lore, Crafting , Languages,... ) to distinguish them. For example, a character may know leatherwork and forging, both crafting abilities, the option field will allow to differentiate between the two.

This is useful when you need to tell the system which ability you are talking about. With afinities or puissant ability virtues for example.

  

# Diary

## I cannot select the ability I want to progress into.

A character must possess an ability in order to progress into it. Add the ability from a compendium with a score of 0 or drag and drop them on the diary sheet's abilities tab (the latter doesn't work with training and teaching)

# Rolls

## How do I know where the roll total comes from?

There is a unfoldable section if you click "details" in the chat message

## How do I use confidence points?

There is a little button in the chat message which will allow that if the character has enough confidence point left.

# Combat

## How do I apply damage to a character?

Click on the "Soak" link in the combat tab and set a value. If a combat is on going, it will automatically compute the correct amount to soak. The size is taken into account.
