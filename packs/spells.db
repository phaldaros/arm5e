The affected fires all take on a slightly unnatural appearance as their flames move into a configuration that does not completely match the logs that they are burning, and they are altered by the sigil of the casting wizard.\nWhen Ranulfs apprentice is away from him, the apprentice is instructed to kindle a fire using a coal stored in the Chest of the Ember Seed just after sunset every evening. While this spell is normally intended to unite two fires, the spell was designed with a Target of Group. Ranulf believed that the effort required to create a spell that affected just two fires would be as great as or greater than the work needed to develop a spell that targeted a group, because of the difficulty of using non-standard Targets. As a result, more than two fires can be affected by this spell, and the caster could be completely unaware of the additional fires (possibly allowing a communication to be intercepted, see Discourse of Glowing Tongues above).\nThis spell is an example of magic created to match the needs of the magus. For most magi, any number of Intellego spells would provide a significantly easier method of communication. Yet for Ranulf, who has a Magical Focus in unnatural fires and the Deficient Technique Flaw with Intellego, the season that he invested to invent this spell was a wiser choice than trying to learn magics not suited to his talents.</p>","source":"MoH","page":112,"technique":{"value":"re","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"ig","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"arc"},"duration":{"value":"sun"},"target":{"value":"group"},"level":35,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":3,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-ignem.bZVSJOkV127JyxqL"},"cf":{"id":"temp_s0fjqplilzk","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Ignem","color":"#ff0000"}},"_id":"1PFtSqvfVanWygom"}

Both the exterior and the rooms within become regular: rightangled and with straight sides, or perfectly circular. Irregularities in workmanship are easily perfected, but the building is not redesigned.\nNormal medieval building design often prevents this spell from working: most medieval buildings have irregular extensions and out-buildings requiring redesign to count as regular — although demolition of the extensions is an easy corrective option. If the whole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can usually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of the Well- Designed Chamber.\nA building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. It is also stronger and more stable against tremors and storms, and has a pleasing air to those beholding it, or living and working within. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.\nIf there is doubt about the limits of perfection, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.)

{"name":"Harmonic Metamorphosis of the Beast","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-glow-blue-purple.webp","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify>;\">This spell can only be successfully cast by those with the Hermetic Metamorphosis Virtue. It requires the immobilized body of the recipient animal, and the donor organ. If the donor derives from another animal, it too must be immobilized. During the casting of the spell, the caster removes the organ from the donor and grafts it to the recipient. The spell resizes the organ (if necessary) and joins up the blood supply and internal organs. The type of organs that can be transplanted are functional units of the animal — its head, pair of hind legs, tail, pair of hands, heart, and so forth. A replacement organ involves the removal of the recipient’s organ and putting the donor organ in its place. If the caster wishes he may take the recipient’s original organ and put it in the space left on the donor, but this requires two surgical rolls (see below), one for each animal. A transposed organ involves the recipient gaining an organ without removing something first; for example, giving it a pair of wings or a second head. The donor animal (if any) dies as a result of this type of surgery. Magical surgery of this type can be purely anatomical, or else confer a Virtue from the donor to the recipient. An anatomical change can grant the recipient a new ability (such as flight) or a Quality (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 40-43). A Virtue can be any General Virtue that derives from the body of the animal; such as Keen Vision, Long-Winded, or Tough. A donor who loses a Virtue due to this spell receives the Enfeebled Flaw if it survives the surgery. The ritual surgery performed as part of the magical actions of casting this spell needs to be performed accurately to ensure the success of the spell. This requires a Dexterity + Chirurgy roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If the organ is transposed rather than replaced, the Ease Factor has a +3 modifier. If the surgery grants a Virtue rather than an anatomical change, the Ease Factor has an additional +3 modifier. If the surgery roll fails then the animal dies soon after the casting of the spell. If the surgery roll botches, then the spell creates some dreadful monster instead.\nExample: Marcus wishes to swap the head of a lion and an eagle in his first step to creating a griffin. Eagles have the Keen Vision Virtue, so this is more than simple anatomical surgery. To successfully implant the eagle’s head on the lion s body, his surgery roll has an Ease Factor of 12. He needs only a 9 to successfully implant the lion s head on the eagle s body, but the lion-headed eagle that results suffers from the Enfeebled Flaw. The spell compensates for the vast difference in size between the two heads.</p>","source":"MoH","page":83,"technique":{"value":"cr","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":true,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"an","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"moment"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":35,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":1,"baseLevel":25,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":true,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-animal.Y7M4cbo9jfSmtRlL"},"cf":{"id":"temp_mzizli65cm","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Animal","color":"#8f5300"}},"_id":"4uVGJgl8zXeOf3qn"}

{"name":"The Hands of Phereclus","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-glow-blue-purple.webp","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify>;\">Given enough lumber and prepared iron nails and other fixtures, this craft magic spell constructs an entire ship from the assembled raw materials. The design of the ship can be decided as the magus works the spell, and enough lumber can be controlled by the spell to create a ship of up to size +8. The free Terram requisite allows control and manipulation of the nails, bricks, and other mineral elements, but it cannot prepare them from raw materials; they must be in the required state.\nAs with all craft magic, a Perception + Finesse roll is required and, given the difficulty of creating a full vessel in little more than an instant, the Ease Factor is relatively high. Small ships, up to size +5, can ordinarily be built in a single season, while larger ships take multiple seasons. The following table takes this into account and provides a guide to Craft Magic Ease Factors for creating vessels of different sizes: [TABLE] .\nIn the table earlier, building a river barge is a relatively easy task for a shipwright, which is a base Ease Factor of 9, but the construction is likely to take up to a season, which adds +6 to the Ease Factor for a total of 15. Building a Mediterranean grain barge is an impressive feat (Ease Factor 21) and would normally take a shipwright a year (+9), which means a magus faces an Ease Factor of 30 to create such a vessel with craft magic. Given the relatively high Ease Factors involved, this spell is most likely to be used in constructing small vessels very quickly as a means of income for the shipyard.\nThe spell is named for Phereclus, a master shipbuilder of Greek antiquity.</p>","source":"HP","page":63,"technique":{"value":"re","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"he","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":true,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"moment"},"target":{"value":"group"},"level":40,"targetSize":3,"complexity":1,"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":5,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-herbam.Q7SBgawXPOtOOB8I"},"cf":{"id":"temp_4tmd159niss","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Herbam","color":"#3e9603"}},"_id":"58axC6aQBdYmi0aO"}

Possession is treated like level 25 Rego Mentem effect.\nThis spell does not summon a ghost. Its designer assumed that he would have the ghost he wished to use stored in a mirror. Tremere magi are supplied with ghosts by Leadworkers, or call them up.\nThis spell allows the magus to give the ghost complex, unbreakable instructions, but Assessors find it best to convince their ghosts to assist. This is not difficult, because most ghosts are tied to the Earth by a piece of unfinished business that they cannot accomplish.

On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls of 6+, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder’s grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder’s behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores. The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has no Soak, and is “killed” after it takes a wound depending on its size.

This allows a mundane farmer to walk the orchard and bring trees to blossom as he passes.

The magic is of Momentary Duration, but the sleeping mind is more able to assimilate the huge amount of information that might be called up, weaving it into the caster’s dreams throughout the night. Note that this spell does not allow the caster to actually talk with the object or divine any secrets that the object may store in whatever passes for its intelligence.\nThis spell uses Terram in its all-encompassing form referencing all solid objects, and requires casting requisites appropriate for the target object.\nThe Vim requisite allows the spell to inform the caster of any active or any recent magical effects on the object. This spell is restricted to effects originating from the Magic Realm. Enchantments inherent to the object are not learned beyond a knowledge that some form of enchantment exists.\nYestin’s version of this spell sees him conversing with the object within his dreams, wherein the object adopts a persona (or rather, Yestin’s dream ascribes a personality to the object). Multiple castings of this spell on multiple objects are possible, though the caster’s pillow as well as his dreams may become a little crowded.\nThe quirkiness of the spell effect is due to experimentation. Yestin had intended for a more conventional spell, but he found towards the end of his experiments that the spell’s incantation wasn’t complete until the caster fell asleep. His Laboratory Text for this spell carries the same flaw. It’s possible that practitioners and researchers of Dream Magic may be interested in Yestin’s text for this spell, as it may further their own magical aims.</p>","source":"MoH","page":141,"technique":{"value":"in","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"te","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":true},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"moment"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":25,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":1,"baseLevel":15,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-terram.COVQEYG7ovtShXw4"},"cf":{"id":"temp_m16962ti6dd","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Terram","color":"#3d1b00"}},"_id":"Eb74enDBzbkMdZuv"}

The affected people think themselves to be in a large, comfortable, well-lit room sitting around a table sufficiently large to seat every member of the bloodline, rather than at their actual locations. Those affected by the spell perceive their relatives to be with them in this room. The room itself is heavily influenced by the caster’s wizard’s sigil.\nThe members of the bloodline are able to speak to one another as if they were in the same room. If a member of the bloodline is asleep when Family Gathering is cast, the spell will not wake that family member; instead that person will experience the spell as a dream and he will have no easier of a time remembering the meeting than he would have remembering any other dream. The words and actions of a dreaming person are often, but not always, sufficiently odd to alert other participants to his or her state.\nDuring the spell’s duration, none of the family are able to receive information from their normal senses. (In terms of the mind as explained in Art and Academe, the forms and images collected by the target’s senses are overwritten in the target’s common sense by the Family Gathering spell). The targets of this spell are still able to move and control their bodies, but their inability to perceive their actual surroundings makes this a dangerous proposition.\nPrior to inventing this spell, Lambert on occasion spontaneously cast a Range: Personal, Target: Bloodline version of Words of the Unbroken Silence and used Familial Secrets to communicate with his children, but he found such communication to be very taxing. Lambert created Family Gathering to facilitate clear communication. This spell is specifically designed to not Warp members of Lambert’s bloodline.</p>","source":"MoH","page":67,"technique":{"value":"mu","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":true,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"me","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"personal"},"duration":{"value":"conc"},"target":{"value":"other"},"level":40,"targetSize":0,"complexity":3,"enhancingRequisite":1,"baseLevel":15,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-mentem.NlTj3f2GVTrw9DKf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_zf1h8nxenmg","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Mentem","color":"#ed8b02"}},"_id":"GrVR3NfUuFlgZFZZ"}

{"name":"Lay Your Burdens on Me","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-glow-blue-purple.webp","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify>;\">This spell brings the target’s secrets bubbling to the top of his consciousness, playing on his mind and making him more inclined to disclose them.\nFor the purposes of this spell, secrets are those things that gnaw at the target’s conscience in the face of questioning — those things that the target would normally strive to keep hidden because of guilt or shame or fear. Secrets kept for noble reasons are not affected by this spell, which was a conscious design decision made by Yestin. This spell does not make the target susceptible to questioning on other matters, and so cannot be used to assist directed interrogation.\nAt the end of the spell’s duration, the target must make a personality roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the target succeeds, she maintains control over her secret and keeps it hidden. The troupe should agree which Personality trait the target uses in the roll.\nFor each subsequent day that the spell is cast on the target, the Ease Factor increases by 1. Virtues and Flaws may modify the roll and/or the Ease Factor, with the Storyguide’s agreement.\nIf the personality check fails, the target falls prey to his conscience and seeks someone to confide in. That person may not necessarily be the caster of the spell, and will most likely be someone the target feels he can trust. The Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact on this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects of human life. If the target spends time in the Dominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the truth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the target’s roll. The aura’s Temper (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave, Wise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura’s effect by 1.\nIf the target spends the duration of the spell within an Infernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura reinforces the target’s resolve to keep the secret. The level of the aura is added to the target’s roll. The Storyguide may impose a further bonus to the roll based on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal aura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13).\nYestin invented this spell as a means to more easily solve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him into; mysteries often solved by knowing what those involved wished to hide.</p>","source":"MoH","page":141,"technique":{"value":"re","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"me","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"eye"},"duration":{"value":"sun"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":20,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":5,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-mentem.srk7MAdx5mABZUrO"},"cf":{"id":"temp_zf1h8nxenmg","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Mentem","color":"#ed8b02"}},"_id":"KCJKPcQUQgwLG11N"}

Enduring the Witch Moon is automatic. This replaces the normal effects of gaining two or more Warping Points, which for Hermetic magi is a roll for Twilight.\nThis effect is inspired by observing the Witch Moon endured by a subject Folk Witch.\nIf you are not using the Hedge Magic: Revised Edition rules, then the following should suffice: .\nThe target immediately develops a fever, treated as a Medium Wound. For the period of a month, the target is unable to draw upon their Gift either to use Supernatural Abilities or to cast spells. This potentially disrupts laboratory work, although the use of enchanted devices is unaffected. At the end of the month, make a roll to see if the Witch Moon has passed: .\nTo End Witch Moon: Stamina — Warping Score + stress die vs Ease Factor 6 .\nIf this roll fails, then the target gains another Warping Point and the Witch Moon lasts for another month, inflicting another Medium Wound on the due to fever. Roll again at the end of the second month and so forth, until the target recovers. If the roll to end the Witch Moon is botched, the target gains an additional number of Warping Points equal to the number of Os of the botch die.

A familiar normally flees into the wilderness and avoids all future contact with magi. The former familiar cannot normally be rebound.</p>","source":"HoH:TL","page":15,"technique":{"value":"pe","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"vi","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"moment"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":0,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":true,"ritual":true,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-vim.MdtFP8U0VMD4LTer"},"cf":{"id":"temp_xivgtwjhcb","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Vim","color":"#c2c2c2"}},"_id":"O51kKD5ptvKUw4NO"}

Botch dice on this Finesse roll are equal to 1 + 1 for each other level where the magus failed to meet the Finesse roll (failures should be recorded for future reference). This represents the inherent complexities and dangers of the project.\nBotches on this roll should be handled as story events, but clearly a botch in creating and assembling several thousand tons of stone is going to be significant. As the tower grows, the complexity of controlling the magic also grows, as does the risk of disaster, which may act as a limiting factor on the number of levels a magus would feel safe in conjuring.\nNote that by increasing the level of this spell by one magnitude, 40 levels of the tower could be produced, and 400 levels could be produced by increasing the spell by two magnitudes. But doing so should have a direct impact on the number of botch dice for the required Finesse roll.

The foundations extend deep into the earth, forming cellars, crypts, and cisterns between the immense stone pillars driven into the ground.\nThe time taken to develop this ritual is spent not only in learning how to draw the complex magical forces together, but also in designing the foundations and the lowest levels of the tower, which are filled with rooms, cloisters, courtyards, and arcades.\nCreo magic that creates artificial things, such as this huge tower, requires an Int + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor, in this case, of 12. If the roll fails, the tower is still successfully conjured but may require additional work to improve its appearance or to repair defects introduced by the casting. A failed Finesse roll creates a section of tower of shoddy quality, while a successful roll creates a standard quality section. If the Finesse roll botches, the foundations are not strong enough to support the tower and a stress check against damage is required each year.\nThe +7 magnitudes for size creates a circular tower of two levels, 2,000 feet in diameter, standing 40 feet above ground level. The high modifier for the elaborate design is required for the precise placement of the foundations, a hugely important factor in a tower this large.\nCasting this ritual causes a +1 preternatural tether, as per Realms of Power: Magic, page 10.

{"name":"Aegis of the Hearth","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-glow-blue-purple.webp","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify>;\">This ritual protects a covenant in the way a Parma Magica protects a magus.\nIf any spell is cast toward the Aegis (originating from outside it) by any magus who was not involved in the Aegis ritual, the Aegis resists the spell. Furthermore, spells that bring objects into the Aegis, including teleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride, are also resisted unless the caster was involved in the ritual. If the foreign spell cannot penetrate a resistance equal to the level of the Aegis, it fizzles out. The Aegis is also able to block foreign Intellego spells, even if they cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica, and spells that were cast before they entered the Aegis, such as an invisibility spell cast on a magus outside the Aegis.\nMagi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast spells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from all their Casting Totals. Spells successfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g. Ignem spells still do full damage). Penetration totals for magical creatures are reduced by the same amount.\nEffects from enchanted devices are resisted by the Aegis unless the item was within the Aegis at the time of casting, or was created within the Aegis by someone who was part of the ritual or in possession of a token.\nCreatures with a Might score cannot enter the area protected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might than the Aegis s level. When approaching the border of an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic magus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical, Infernal, Faerie, and Divine creatures and persons may be brought.\nSuch a person is also not affected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The invitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not require retrieving the token or even notifying the individual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an invitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis, but will prevent them from re-entering after they leave (unless their Might is high enough), and subject them to the Casting Total penalty while they are within the Aegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be issued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not necessarily by the same magus. A magus may only invite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may not expel someone he does not know has been invited in.\nThe Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since magical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and the Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire covenant usually participates in the Aegis ritual, which often ends with the participants walking around the perimeter of the protected area in order to define it. Quite often, the covenant holds a major council meeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the Aegis. Magi do not need to be able to cast the spell to participate in the ritual, and, indeed, non-Hermetic wizards can participate as well. Only one magus needs to actually cast the spell.\nAegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a major breakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220 Notatus’s discoveries have spread, and any magus trained in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters, but at different levels. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require a similar breakthrough, and years of research.</p>","source":"ArM5","page":161,"technique":{"value":"re","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"vi","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"year"},"target":{"value":"bound"},"level":0,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":true,"ritual":true,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-vim.E5GtwCU5QoEayeFy"},"cf":{"id":"temp_xivgtwjhcb","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Vim","color":"#c2c2c2"}},"_id":"bCUORSE6808ZA3ZM"}

This ability to gust is intrinsic to the type of wind into which the caster turns, much as the Cloak of Mist (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 131) allows the caster to seep through cracks like natural mist. Note that because this spell turns the caster into a gale wind, she cannot travel any more slowly than 50 miles an hour. A different spell (of the same level) is needed to turn into a more gentle wind. The caster inhales a gust of wind to cast this spell, and can end the spell and transform back into human form by letting this captured wind free.\nWhile in the form of a wind, she can attempt to bowl over any object her size or smaller; this requires making roll of Strength + Concentration + stress die against the target’s Stamina + stress die.

If the caster’s roll exceeds her opponent’s, then the target is knocked off his feet and flung backwards one foot for every point of the difference. As a violent storm wind, the target is instead flung three feet per point of the difference. Falling damage (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 181) is inflicted on those knocked over; hitting an obstruction before the full distance flung back is reached counts as falling onto a hard surface (such as a wall) or a soft surface (such as a haystack).

As an example, a magus carting odd spell components into a city may convince the guards that they are “geegaws,” or some other meaningless category, and thus unimportant.\nThis will not work if the guard already has a simile that includes things that look like spell components, for example “tools of the Devil.”</p>","source":"HoH:S","page":69,"technique":{"value":"cr","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"me","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"eye"},"duration":{"value":"sun"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":20,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":5,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-mentem.rULxnFjwLTyV0cm5"},"cf":{"id":"temp_zf1h8nxenmg","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Mentem","color":"#ed8b02"}},"_id":"bL5AwGRTAVJRVFmP"}

The mark is a large visual representation of the sigil of the magus. The spell’s creator had a shadowy sigil, so the grogs she marked appeared dark and featureless, giving the spell its name. The spell can be cast on any group of people, and can project any sort of visual mark, so Tremere magi also use it for processions and sport. Any Awareness roll concerning the location of forces has a +3 bonus while this spell is in effect.

The eventual shape of the plant is determined when the spell is cast and it can be as simple or as complex as the magus desires, although truly complicated designs, such as making a bush grow in the shape of someone’s face, may require a Finesse check. Once the plant reaches the shape and dimensions that the magus wishes, it stops growing until the spell ends or a new spell is cast upon it. Once the spell ends, the plant will then grow normally, but it still retains its magically ‘pruned’ shape, until it grows naturally out of it. Fast grow spells, or other methods used to accelerate the growth of plants, will still work, but until this spell ends the plant will not grow past the design limits originally set.

The spell does not enhance the caster’s natural sight or hearing.\nThe caster has some freedom to move his vantage point, but cannot move into any place that he cannot naturally see from his physical location. Moving the viewpoint requires a Simple Stamina + Concentration Roll vs. Ease Factor 6.\nThe “plethron” of the spell title is a Greek measurement roughly equivalent to 100 feet, although the spell’s range allows for a potentially greater distance.\nPetalichus and his brother Cononites have investigated this spell, as Petalichus had anticipated that he would be able to use it to gain sight of new viable targets. This proved not to be the case. William Bonisagi theorized that the species, recreated as they are, bear insufficient connection to the things they represent to support casting spells against them. By being so far removed, the magus would essentially be attempting to cast his spells on mere apparitions.\nHowever, using this spell to aid with Hermetic Geometry spells (those using Arcane Line, Arcane Circle, and Arcane Ring) reduces the Distance Level by 1 if the caster can now see his target. This is cumulative with other spells or devices that may also reduce the Distance Level (see The Worldly Halysis later).\nThe Target is based on Room, but is more complex as it allows unbounded spaces to be targeted.

{"name":"Let This Fire Sing You to Sleep","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-glow-blue-purple.webp","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify>;\">This spell affects a single fire, turning the very tips of the flames into pleasing music. The caster decides the kind of music he wishes to hear (a ballad, a whirly jig, etc.), and the spell accommodates. The music of the flames always incorporates a signature refrain, as though a sigil, with each casting. But the mood of that same refrain is adapted to the needs of the song.\nThe flames play the same music all the while the fire burns, getting louder as the fire burns brighter, hotter, or larger, though the random nature of fire and differences in fuel mean that no two castings ever produce exactly the same performance.\nThe spell ends when the flame is extinguished, its original source is fully destroyed or, for particularly long- burning fires, when the spell’s Sun Duration naturally expires. This spell cannot affect a fire that is already larger than a campfire or a fire in a hearth (essentially, any fire doing +5 damage), but a fire that grows larger than this retains the magic.\nYestin originally designed this spell so that his fire, whether on the road or in his sanctum, could gently sing him to sleep. But the more he explored this new spell, the more he found new uses for it. It wasn’t just music that the flames could produce, but also speech (though limited in the range of words and voice to little more than those the caster imagines as he casts the spell) or other natural and unnatural sounds. These sounds always adopt the rhythm of the spell’s original melody, though. If left to sing (or talk) of its own volition, with no guidance from the caster, the fire sounds as though it is forming words, but this is an illusion; the sounds form true words by accident if at all.\nYestin has used this spell in his sanctum to experiment with different harmonies, and has on occasion established choirs of candles each quietly singing a different refrain or a different note. The effect can be mesmerizing.\nA Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this to a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is, but the size of the fire determines how loud it is.

Attacking with this spell normally takes two rounds: one to move the stone over the target, and another to aim and release it.\nDamage inflicted depends mainly on the size of the stone: +5 for a stone the size of a man’s fist, +10 for a typical building- stone, up to +21 for a large boulder (see also the Impact Table on page 181 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition).

He then pours scorpions into the ring this creates, and orders them to attack anyone else that crosses the ring, casting the spell multiple times if he feels it is necessary.

For larger (and thus more powerful) elementals, this spell must be invented with a Size modifier to the target, with each application of the modifier giving +3 Size. Since Size determines Might (see later), 1 extra size magnitude gives an elemental a Might of 20 (Size +3), 2 a Might of 25 (Size +6), etc. This spell doesn’t need to penetrate the Might of the elemental instantiated; until the completion of the spell, the elemental doesn’t exist.</p>","source":"RoP:M","page":133,"technique":{"value":"cr","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"aq","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"touch"},"duration":{"value":"moment"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":30,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":25,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":true,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-aquam.6AWrj1cbC6NhjjE3"},"cf":{"id":"temp_wfqrct5dm4","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Aquam","color":"#296dc7"}},"_id":"laMkZNB5CbOpqmm5"}

A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 12 if raw fleece is employed, or 9 if the base material is spun wool. The clothes produced are of standard quality; increase the Ease Factor for particularly fine or complex craft. If the Finesse roll fails, the caster is left with a useless mess of wool. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor.

It has no effect if the target is already bound as a familiar to another.\nCasting requisites of a Technique and Form appropriate to the creature’s nature and physical form may be included. These two Arts are used to determine the Lab Total for any subsequent improvements to the bond. The cords connecting maga and familiar have initial values of 0, and the vis cost of this ritual does not apply towards these improvements. The maga can strengthen the bond in the lab, but the effect is still inherently temporary. If she casts this on a faerie, she gains the three special powers (Shared Powers, Shared Senses, and Shared Fatigue) associated with a faerie familiar, but the cords will decay as normal, though the bond is never completely broken so long as the spell’s duration remains in effect.\nBecause the bond is often made under duress, the familiar is much more wild and independent than normal familiars, and typically must be subdued or guarded to ensure it does not try to escape.

The area covered by the falling glass is about 10 paces across, and anyone in (or passing through) the area takes +10 damage. If a wound is caused, blood from the victim falls onto the earth.\nThis is an Aimed spell that consequently bypasses Magic Resistance, and there is a +12 bonus to the Aiming roll to hit due to the number of glass shards (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 86). This Aiming bonus is for a cloud of shards that contains 100 cubic paces of glass. If the cloud of shards contains only 10 cubic paces of glass, the Aiming bonus is reduced to only +6. Remember to count Defense bonuses because of shields.\nThis spell requires that the caster has large collection of sharp glass shards, which need to be mundane in order to bypass Magic Resistance in this way. The shards could be created using a momentary Creo Terram ritual (such as The Shattered Goblet), or they could be acquired from a mundane craftsman, although this is probably more expensive and inconvenient for most magi.

The target of the spell is a singer’s voice (or the sound produced by a single musical instrument), and the spell allows the caster to pull that voice in all manner of directions. For example, it pulls notes higher, pushes them lower, draws them out longer, or cuts them off sharply.\nAs the caster must anticipate the music or song as it is being performed, the spell requires a Finesse roll to affect the sound to a greater or lesser degree. On a high Finesse roll (9 or higher), the caster is able to change words within the song, or change entire chords within the music. At the lowest level, the caster is able to at least change some of the music to bad notes or add a croak in the voice.\nFinesse Roll: 3+ .\nEffect: Causes occasional breaks in the voice or the random bad or missed note.\nFinesse Roll: 6+ .\nEffect: The caster can choose to manipulate the performance such that it appears to simply be a good player on a bad night. The target voice might sound strained or croaky, and instruments may sound in need of tuning.\nFinesse Roll: 9+ .\nEffect: The caster can make the singer sound tone deaf, flattening a performance or pitching the music off key.\nFinesse Roll: 12+ .\nEffect: The caster achieves a fine level of control, and can even change words within a song to any other words of his choosing.\nIf the caster is familiar with the song or the piece of music, he may add his Music score to his Finesse roll as there is less need to anticipate the performance.\nIt may be possible to apply the spell to the spoken word, perhaps to an orator or a tutor as he addresses an audience, although Yestin has not yet experimented with this.</p>","source":"MoH","page":140,"technique":{"value":"mu","label":"Technique"},"technique-req":{"cr":false,"in":false,"mu":false,"pe":false,"re":false},"form":{"value":"im","label":"Form"},"form-req":{"an":false,"aq":false,"au":false,"co":false,"he":false,"ig":false,"im":false,"me":false,"te":false,"vi":false},"range":{"value":"sight"},"duration":{"value":"conc"},"target":{"value":"ind"},"level":5,"targetSize":0,"complexity":[],"enhancingRequisite":0,"baseLevel":1,"baseEffectDescription":"","general":false,"ritual":false,"bonus":0,"exp":0,"mastery":0,"masteryAbilities":"","applyFocus":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.spell-imaginem.gPyefI8cyAIgFQhm"},"cf":{"id":"temp_93hbv15lejt","path":"Spells#/CF_SEP/Imaginem","color":"#07cfc1"}},"_id":"p0pn2NsNTR5YQxhG"}
