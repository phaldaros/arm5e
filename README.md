This is a Foundry VTT system for Ars Magica 5th Edition.

This package is intended to enable Ars Magica play using Foundry VTT. In order to play, official Ars Magica materials are still required. Official material for Ars Magica 5th edition is published by and may be purchased from Atlas Games (https://atlas-games.com).

## Installation of the development version

If you want to test the newest features in advance before release and give precious feedback and suggestions:

Copy the following url in the Foundry dialog to install new systems (at the bottom, there is a text field) an click install

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xzotl42/arm5e/master/system.json

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to do a backup of your world before updating.

ALSO IMPORTANT: The dev system and the official releases can not exist in parallel in the same Foundry data folder. To have both versions, you can follow this [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/B74ZAp3xx3o) by Encounter library: a very clear process on how to do it step by step. (Instead of installing the V10 as in the video, install the latest stable V9, then install the dev version as explained below)

## Abandonment

Abandoned modules are a (potential) problem for Foundry, because users and/or other modules might rely on abandoned modules, which might break in future Foundry updates.<br>
I consider this module abandoned if all of the below cases apply:

<ul>
  <li>This module/github page has not received any updates in at least 3 months</li>
  <li>I have not posted anything on "the Foundry", "the League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" or the "ArM5e FoundryVTT System Development" Discord servers in at least 3 months</li>

  <li>I have not responded to emails or PMs on Discord in at least 1 month</li>
  <li>I have not announced a temporary break from development, unless the announced end date of this break has been passed by at least 3 months</li>
</ul>
If the above cases apply (as judged by the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins), I give permission to the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to assign one or more developers to take over this module, including requesting the Foundry team to reassign the module to the new developer(s).<br>
I require the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to send me an email 2 weeks before the reassignment takes place, to give me one last chance to prevent the reassignment.<br>
I require to be credited for my work in all future releases.
